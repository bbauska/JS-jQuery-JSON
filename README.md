JavaScript, jQuery and JSON
By Charles Russell Severance, Clinical Professor University of Michigan

We take a quick look at the JavaScript language. We assume that you already know PHP - so it is a pretty quick introduction focusing on what is different about JavaScript.

Learning Objectives
•	Describe how and when JavaScript is executed in the browser
•	Describe the three ways that JavaScript can be placed within a web page
•	Build and debug simple JavaScript code snippets
•	Demonstrate how to debug JavaScript errors using the browser developer console
•	Give examples of JavaScript manipulating the HTML Document Object Model (DOM)
•	Describe the history of the JavaScript language, where and when it was developed, and its relationship to Java
•	Explain the asynchronous nature of JavaScript in the browser
•	Understand how and when the code in an "onlick" attribute is executed

Welcome to JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON, taught by Charles Severance!
In this course, we'll look at the JavaScript language, and how it supports the Object-Oriented pattern, with a focus on the unique aspect of how JavaScript approaches OO. We'll explore a brief introduction to the jQuery library, which is widely used to do in-browser manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling. You'll also learn more about JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which is commonly used as a syntax to exchange data between code running on the server (i.e. in PHP) and code running in the browser (JavaScript/jQuery).
It is assumed that learners have already taken the Building Web Applications and Building Database Applications in PHP courses in this specialization.
